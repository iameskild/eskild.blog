## About

I consider this blog to be my home on the web, a place where I write, create and share topics that interest me. I’m not sure what it means yet, but I believe the phrase “professional, yet playful” encapsulates the theme I am going for...


## Development Setup

This site is built using the [Hugo static-site generator](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Run to start the local development server:

```
hugo server
```
> include `-D` for include drafts

Then open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:1313`.


### Theme Customization

To modify HTML templates, add or modify files in `layouts/`.

To modify CSS styling, add or modify files in `assets/css/extended/`.


### Adding Content

To create a new post run:

```
hugo new content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-short-name.md
```

Add images `static/images/`.
