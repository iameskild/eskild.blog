Forest fires bring death and destruction, yet they can also catalyze the birth of new plant life. The fire clears the overcrowded underbrush to create space and opportunities for the next generation, a cycle necessary for the health of the forest. However, like so many things, the quantity matters. No or too little fire and not enough space is created for the next generation, while on the other hand, too much fire and the entire forest burns down.

There are species of tree that uniquely thrives in this cycle of destruction and regeneration, one such tree is the Giant Sequoia.

Giant Sequoias hold the record for the largest tree by volume, specifically [General Sherman with a trunk volume of over 1,480 cubic meters (52,500 cubic feet)](https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/largest-trees-in-world.htm), they can grow up to 85 meters (280 feet) tall, and their gorgeous red-brown bark can grow up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) thick. The thickness of their bark (and lack of flammable sap) makes these mature Giant Sequoias resistant to most fires.

The reproductive process of the Giant Sequoia and forest fires are intimately linked. The cones of the Giant Sequoia are serotinous, meaning they require an external trigger — in this case, fire — to release their seeds. The heat of the raging forest fire causes these tightly sealed cones to dry out and open up, setting their seeds free. With the cleared forest floor and the remaining nutrient-rich layer of ash, these seeds have an opportunity to germinate and become the next generation of Giant Sequoias.

When you're up close to a mature Giant Sequoia, you can often see the scars of past fires. You might be comforted knowing their offspring may be nearby

As I write this, I reflect on the ideas of resilience, adaptation, and creative destruction in the broadest sense. It's April 2023, and some tangible form of AI is already here. Are humans like the Giant Sequoias, ready to use this power to elevate our capabilities and grow and develop to even greater heights? Or are we like the old and dying underbrush that is about to be burnt away to make way for a new form of life? 

Or is my analogy being stretched too far? Either way, I can't help but feel a sense of uncertainty about the future, a mixture of both anxiety and excitement.

Our ancestors harnessed the power of fire and heat and it has been the stuff of legend ever since. It undoubtedly unlocked even greater opportunities for good and for ill. If we surveyed the world population, I think it's safe to assume we'd all prefer a world with fire than one without.

Artificial intelligence is humanity's newest fire! A fire that listens and speaks. The perfect material for new cautionary tales and fantastical stories, the kind that humbles you with your unique insignificance while reminding you that you, yes you, are god!

Innovations as large and sweeping as the harnessing of fire or the creation of artificial intelligence have the property that they force the world to adapt to them in fundamental ways. Will AI burn too hot and burn the forest down, even the mighty Giant Sequoias?
