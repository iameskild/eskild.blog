<sup>Big Berried Manzanita (NPS)</sup>

Trees are so vital to this planet and everything living on it but it seems this fact has been often overlooked or forgotten. Trees offer shelter for animals and beautiful building material for humans, they shade us in the summer and hold hillsides together, and the list goes on. However, trees (and other green plants) play a far more critical role; they are the lungs of our planet.

To honor our important friends, once a month for the year of 2021, I will share a post on a specific tree I find fascinating or have recently discovered myself. Some trees will be familiar to most, some trees might only be appreciated by scientist working closely with them. All of them will inspire awe and appreciation.

The explicit goals of this series are to introduce myself to more fascinating and beautiful trees while sharing my excitement with others. My wish is for trees, and our natural environment more broadly, to be looked upon with a set of fresh eyes, and fundamentally, respected for all their forgotten benefits. 

As far as I am aware, there exists not a tree in the universe besides here on Earth. As the species with the greatest ability to affect our surroundings, we ought to take better care of the trees, so they can take care of all of us.

On the morning of Thanksgiving 2020, my roommate and I eagerly made our way up [Condor Gulch trail](https://www.nps.gov/pinn/planyourvisit/maps.htm) to marvel at the rock formations this under-appreciated park was known for. And as the sun rose and the morning chill subsided, we took a break to remove some layers, when we realized we were in the presences of a tree neither of us had ever seen before. 

It was the distinct, metallic-like, red bark that first drew our attention, and our instant admiration.

I felt compelled to research this tree – what I would come to know as the [Big Berried Manzanita (Arctostaphylos glauca)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctostaphylos_glauca) – and this is exactly what I did when I got home.

Technically more of a large shrub than a tree, these striking evergreen plants are native to the chaparral regions of California and Baja California and have evolved an extraordinary robustness. They grow well in acidic soils, are resistant to heat, drought and cold, and can live up to 100 years

As their name suggests, the Big Berried Manzanitas are known for their relatively large, red berries and is what distinguishes them from other manzanita species.

The general term, manzanita, comes to us from the Spanish who thought the red berries resembled little red apples; the Spanish diminutive of "manzana" or apple.

These Big Berried Manzanita can reach heights of up to 6 meters or 20 feet tall, decorated with beautiful blue-green, oval leaves. Although I didn't bring my handy measuring tape with me, I was able to stand comfortably beneath the twisting branches to admire their bark.

A simply wonderful tree.

This trip reminded me of the importance of slowing down. And that the simple pleasures in life – the warmth of a campfire, the exhilaration of moving my body and the enjoyment of an honest conversation with a friend – are some of the best pleasures in life. 

My roommate and I remain extremely grateful for the whole experience. We not only discovered the gorgeous manzanita tree, but as we sat to admire the beautiful pastel-colored rocks, we were fortunate enough to witness the majestic condor soar effortlessly overhead.

I hope this series inspires you, dear reader, to get out and discover for yourself the wonders of our natural world. I will conclude with a quote from legendary naturalist John Muir
