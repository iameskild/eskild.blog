When this blog first launched in 2019, I decided the quickest and easiest way to get started was to use Squarespace. I don't think I was wrong but as my desire for more control over the site grew, a change was needed. 

Introducing [eskild.blog](https://www.eskild.blog), now built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Since I'm not quite ready to build my site from scratch, I figured using a static site generator would give me the control I wanted without the additional maintenance burden that comes with managing a full-fledged, dynamic website.

There are plenty of great static site generators out there but Hugo appears to be both flexible and fast.

As for GitHub Pages, I fully expect to experiment with other hosting solutions but it's the simplest way to get started.

To me, this blog is a work-in-progress, and probably always will be.

Anyway, that's enough for now. Happy blogging.
