Forest fires bring death and destruction, yet they can also catalyze the birth of new plant life. The fire clears the overcrowded underbrush to create space and opportunities for the next generation, a cycle necessary for the health of the forest. However, like so many things, the quantity matters. No, or too little fire and not enough space is created for the next generation, while on the other hand, too much fire and the entire forest burns down.

That said, there exists a species of tree that uniquely thrives in this cycle of destruction and regeneration, the Giant Sequoia. As we'll see, this tree has a lot going for it. 

Giant Sequoias hold the record for the largest tree by volume, specifically [General Sherman with a trunk volume of over 1,480 cubic meters (52,500 cubic feet)](https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/largest-trees-in-world.htm), they can grow up to 85 meters (280 feet) tall, and their gorgeous red-brown bark can grow up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) thick. The thickness of their bark (and lack of flammable sap) makes these mature Giant Sequoias resistant to most fires.

The reproductive process of the Giant Sequoia and forest fires are intimately linked. The cones of the Giant Sequoia are serotinous, meaning they require an external trigger — in this case, fire — to release their seeds. The heat of the raging forest fire causes these tightly sealed cones to dry out and open up, setting their seeds free. With the fire clearing the underbrush and leaving behind a nutrient-rich layer of ash in its wake, these seeds have the opportunity to germinate and become the next generation of Giant Sequoias.

When you gaze at a mature Giant Sequoia, you can often see the scars of past fires and might be comforted by knowing their offspring may be nearby. And as the sunlight streams in through the forest canopy and hits the layered, furrowed, reddish-brown bark, my mind evokes images of dancing flames.

As I write this, I reflect on the ideas of resilience, adaptation, and creative destruction in the broadest sense. It's April 2023, and some tangible form of AI is already here. Are we humans like the Giant Sequoias, ready to use this power to elevate our capabilities and grow and develop to even greater heights? Or are we like the old and dying underbrush that is about to be burnt away to make way for a new form of life? Or is my analogy being stretched too far?  

Either way, I can't help but feel a sense of uncertainty about the future, a mixture of both doomed anxiety and hopeful excitement. Lastly, I want to remind myself and encourage others to get outside and enjoy the world as it is right now because one fact is certain, things are about to change.
