Modern cellphones or smartphones or simply phones retain the name of the single tool they were initially designed as, phones. The irony is that making traditinal cellular phone calls probably makes up a tiny fraction of what most people use their phones for these days. If you're an iPhone user, have a look at your Screen Time to get a more accurate sense of how you *actually* use your phone. If I had to guess, social media, video streaming and messaging top the list and perhaps in quantities that you would be a little embarrassed to admit.

In this post, my hope is to convince you that we should reframe how we think about smartphones and be much, much more selective about what we allow on our devices. The framing I would like us to consider is that of a pocketknife or a multitool, a device with several distict tools that is used when needed and returned to our pockets or purse when not needed. Hopefully by the end of this post, I will have convinced you that a healthier relationship with our phones is in order and shared a few helpful techniques on how to achieve this.

> This post focuses on techniques specific to iPhones. I also assume you have another device such as a tablet, laptop or desktop.

## Why make this change?

To start, I will admit a transition like the one I'm proposing is not necessarily easy, especially if you make all of the changes at once. However, I suggest meditating a little on why you feel this discomfort to begin with. If you're anything like me, it was because idle time was painful and I felt I needed to be entertained right now. This is not entirely you're fault. It's become a bit of an old troupe by now that the large tech companies are in a arms race for your attention. They have thus have built apps and platforms whose main objective is to keep your eyes glued to the screen for as long as possible in order to maximize potential ad revenue. I have felt this and I still feel this.

We have all seen couples at nice resturants, sitting across from each other, each fiddling away on their phones instead of talking. Each of us has been the person who pulls out their phones to scroll when we step in an elevator or having to wait in line at the grocery store. And we've all been in the situation where we were focused at our work only to magically find ourselves on our phones unable to rememeber when we stopped working and starting scrolling.

The changes I propose below will hopefully make each us slightly more engaged in the present moment and train our attention so we can tackle important work in front of us. And perhaps strike up a conversation with a co-worker in the elavator, if that's your thing.

## Purge, purge and purge some more

My first recommendation is simple, purge any application that falls into the following categories:
- social media: Facebook, Instagram, Tik-Tok, Snapchat, X (Twitter), Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.
- video streaming: YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, etc.
- news & sports: CNN, New York Times, Fox News, ESPN, NBA, NFL, etc.
- browser: Chrome, Firefox, etc. (more on why this is important later)
- games

That might literally be more than half of the apps on your phone but I think it's important to purge any app that pulls on your attention in unhelpful ways. Personally, the order above is the priority in which I believe these apps should be removed.

I can already hear some of you saying, I need *insert app* for my job. My first question is, do you really? And if that's truly the case, can the job function not be performed on another device such as your laptop? Can you request a work phone from your company? And if none of those are feasible, would you consider setting a firm App Limit, say 1 hour a day?

There are of course apps that can't be realistically used on any other device besides, namely Snapchat and Instagram (at least for posting new content). So for those apps, honestly consider how important they are to you and if you still want them on your phone, I would highly recommend subjecting them to strict App Limits.

> You can of course add an App Limit to any and all of the apps that I recommend removing. But doesn't that feel a little like cheating?

## Lock it down

At this point, your phone may be unrecognizable to you. But we can go further.

If you took my advice above and also removed all third-party browser, we can use a few additional iPhone Screen Time features to lock down your phone even further. 

Navigate to Content & Privacy Restrictions > Content Restrictions, I recommend > Web Content. From here you should be able to restrict which sites you will allow yourself to access from the Apple's Safari browser. It's no good removing the YouTube app, only to navigate to youtube.com in your browser. Therefore the recommendation is to block all of the sites whose app you just removed; all social media sites, streaming sites, news and sports sites, etc. 

It may also be worth setting the allowed web content to "Limit Adult Websites" as well, especially for you young (and not so young) lads out there.

For these changes to take effect, you will need to toggle the `Content & Privacy Restrictions` button. And finally, I highly recommend setting a Screen Time Passcode so that you are forced to acknowledge when you are breaking your own rules - this will also apply to App Limits.

> HARD MODE: have a friend of partner set the Screen Time Passcode for you ğŸ’ª
