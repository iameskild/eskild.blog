Trees are so vital to this planet and everything living on it but it seems this fact has been often overlooked or forgotten. Trees offer shelter for animals and beautiful building material for humans, they shade us in the summer and hold hillsides together, and the list goes on. However, trees (and other green plants) play a far more critical role; they are the lungs of our planet.

To honor our important friends, once a month for the year of 2021, I will share a post on a specific tree I find fascinating or have recently discovered myself. Some trees will be familiar to most, some trees might only be appreciated by scientist working closely with them. All of them will inspire awe and appreciation.

The explicit goals of this series are to introduce myself to more fascinating and beautiful trees while sharing my excitement with others. My wish is for trees, and our natural environment more broadly, to be looked upon with a set of fresh eyes, and fundamentally, respected for all their forgotten benefits. 

As far as I am aware, there exists not a tree in the universe besides here on Earth. As the species with the greatest ability to affect our surroundings, we ought to take better care of the trees, so they can take care of all of us.
