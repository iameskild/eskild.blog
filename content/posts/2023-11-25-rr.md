At this point, I pay for two AI services, [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) and [GitHub\'s Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) but this number will surely increase in the coming months and years. I think the term "co-pilot" perfectly captures the current relationship; these are tools that help me automate some of the boring or tedious tasks while also acting as an assistant that I can use as a soundboard to help me get unstuck.

While working on a side project recently, I needed a real URL for some testing. As I began to type out `url = "https://`, Co-Pilot generated a suggestion that I could accept by hitting tab. At this point, it didn't matter what the URL was so I accepted the suggestion. Any guesses what the URL was for? What if I told you it was for a YouTube video?

I was curious what video this might be and wanted to ensure it was indeed a real link but I had a hunch what would appear next.

If you guessed, Rick Astley's ["Never Gonna Give You Up" music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), you would be correct. I got [rickrolled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) by my Co-Pilot, damn!

Without going into too much detail on how these Large Language Models (LLMs) work, it's important to know that these LLMs are trained on billions and billions of lines of text data from online sources including blogs, forums, and digitized books, just to name a few.  What this means is that all of entertaining, beautiful, mean, hopeful, hateful, weird and wonderful things we have written, have been internalized by these LLMs.

It's not a huge surprise that a URL generated by Co-Pilot would be one of the most famous internet memes. I would guess it's among the top 5 or 10 most common URLs found in the "wild".
