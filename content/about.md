## Hi, I'm Eskild!

I consider this blog to be my home on the web, a place where I write, create and share topics that interest me. I'm not sure what it means yet, but I believe the phrase "professional, yet playful" encapsulates the theme I am going for.

I am currently a software engineer at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/), living in Los Angeles, California. All thoughts and opinions are my own.

### Say hi

In one of several efforts to connect with new and interesting people, I have set up a [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com) for anyone who wants to schedule a chat. Come say hi!
