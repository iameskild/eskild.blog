### Effective Altruism Los Angeles

For the calendar year of 2024, I was the community organizer for the [Effective Altruism Los Angeles](https://effectivealtruismla.org) city group. While still involved in the community, I have stepped down as I'm in the process of moving to the San Fransisco Bay Area.


### Open Source Software (OSS)

Major open-source software contributions:

- [Nebari](https://nebari.dev) - an opinionated, collaborative JupyterHub distribution that integrates tools and services to help data scientists and machine learning engineers perform their jobs at scale.
  - I was a core developer and release manager for the project for over two years.
- [Argo-Jupyter-Scheduler](https://github.com/nebari-dev/argo-jupyter-scheduler) - an extension for Jupyter-Scheduler to run Jupyter Notebooks as workflows using Argo-Workflows.
  - Initial project developer.
- [kbatch](https://github.com/kbatch-deb/kbatch) - a CLI tool that deploys Jupyter Notebooks as batch jobs on Kubernetes.
