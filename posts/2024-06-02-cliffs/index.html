Grand Canyon (1924) by Gunnar Mauritz Widforss


We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.

Kurt Vonnegut has been on my mind since I encountered it about a month ago. Good quotes can capture a truth about the world in an elegant and poetic ways, always making you wish you had come up with it yourself. The difficulty in trying to describe certain truths is that they cannot, by their very nature, be expressed in language."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2024-06-02-cliffs/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.20f5da520e9c25bdfbb881d9c081cbd338db5d45868abfc3f6fc7232f474cc9d.css integrity="sha256-IPXaUg6cJb37uIHZwIHL0zjbXUWGir/D9vxyMvR0zJ0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2024-06-02-cliffs/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2024-06-02-cliffs/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="eskild.blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Jumping off cliffs"><meta property="og:description" content=" Grand Canyon (1924) by Gunnar Mauritz Widforss We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.

Good quotes can capture a truth about the world in an elegant and poetic ways, always making you wish you had come up with it yourself. The difficulty in trying to describe certain truths is that they cannot, by their very nature, be expressed in language.\nSo what truth does this quote gesture at? Why must we continually jump? And how does one develop wings?\nIn my own way of gesturing at these underlying ideas, I will reflect on a few other quotes.\nFrom Destiny1, a poem by David Whyte:\nStrangely, every person always lives out their destiny no matter what they do, according to the way they shape the conversation… [our destiny’s] promise may depend upon a brave participation, a willingness to hazard ourselves in a difficult world, a certain form of wild generosity with our gifts;…\nOur experience of life “may depend upon a brave participation” — the courage to admit ignorance while striving to eliminate it, the courage to say “I love you” even if you’re unsure you’ll hear it repeated back to you, and the courage to look like a fool while you’re improving your trade.\nThe Gust (c. 1680) by Willem van de Velde the Younger From Michael Nielsen on Conversations with Tyler:\nYou’re constantly expanding the legible, and when you do that, there’s this penumbra of illegibility that surrounds it. That moves, but it gives you access to those other spaces.\nTo think “I’m done, that’s it” is a terrible mistake; we must always be vigilant and ready to learn. As the “other spaces” around you expand, you must face them with renewed bravery and a deeper appreciation of what came before.\nFrom Wayne Gretzky, NHL hockey player (and me after my missed jump shot):\nYou miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.\nYou develop into a shooter by taking shots. There is no other way. This understanding unlocks a certain freedom; to grow, one needs to be challenged, and ultimately, it’s not personal.\nThe Laundress (1863) by Honoré Daumier And why must we continually jump off cliffs? Isn’t once enough?\nFrom Dean W. Ball on Hyperdimensional:\nWe do not know the answer, and it doubtful that there is such a thing as “an answer” to problems of this kind [AI safety]. It is not just that finding the answer will be a process. The answer will be the process.\nEssential processes that don’t evolve to survive in the new environment die. Adaptability is, has, and will likely always be an important ingredient for success. To be good at adaptation, you need to continually adapt.\nAnd from Maya Angelo:\nCourage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can’t practice any other virtue consistently.\nDoing something once doesn’t require the same courage as doing it consistently does. We must continually admit ignorance, say “I love you,” and feel like fools because doing so continually is the only way to improve and find new cliffs to jump off of.\nLooking Down Yosemite Valley (1865) by Albert Bierstadt 1 Or a link to the poem on Facebook.\n","wordCount":"557","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-06-02T01:00:36-07:00","dateModified":"2024-06-02T01:00:36-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2024-06-02-cliffs/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"eskild.blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.eskild.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/ accesskey=h title="eskild.blog (Alt + H)">eskild.blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
