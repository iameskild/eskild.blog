We hear about the rainforest and are reminded of the important role trees play as a global carbon sink, breathing in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through a process known as photosynthesis. We have also known for millennia that some trees produce tasty fruit while others provide wonderful building materials, such as the orange and pine trees respectively.
And a stroll through any forest forces us to appreciate how vital trees are to their ecosystem."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2021-04-30-sm/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.74f2b6592da3d9e6ad8487f9b1d6a94ba7f0a1f77c05d1240389c6770af406d9.css integrity="sha256-dPK2WS2j2eathIf5sdapS6fwofd8BdEkA4nGdwr0Btk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://www.eskild.blog/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://www.eskild.blog/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2021-04-30-sm/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="The Southern Magnolia"><meta property="og:description" content="
