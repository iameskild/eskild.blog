Here&rsquo;s how I got started quickly and cheaply.
Requirements
Besides cost and speed, I have a few other requirements and preferences that should help simplify the process and hopefully make it more useful long-term.
First, given that I&rsquo;m writing this on my M1 Macbook - with it&rsquo;s arm chip - it makes sense for me to have a dedicated x86_64 machine. Second, I want a stable, widely used, Linux OS meant for servers.

Shocker!\nBasically whenever I have to make a decision between a few options, the rule-of-thumb is to go with the simple, common solution.\nNext, I need to decide what software to run on this home lab. For me, the immediate choice is Kubernetes. I want to learn more about how to manage a Kubernetes cluster without relying on one of the cloud providers to do it for me and this would be a fun opportunity to do so.\nAt first, this “cluster” will consist of one node which means application-specific pods will run on the same node as the control-plane and api server.

Add a few more CPU nodes and perhaps a few GPUs and the possibility of running AI workloads is just that much closer.\nI’m getting a little ahead of myself.\nHardware Now to the hardware.\nWhere I can and if the price is right, I’ll go with used/refurbished.\nHere at the core components that I ended up purchasing:\nLenovo ThinkCentre M910Q - refurbished\nIntel Core i7-6700T 32GB RAM 1TB NVMe SSD Price: $250 It came in great condition and with a keyboard and mouse. A bangin’ deal if you ask me!\nNetgear Powerline Adapter Kit - used\n2 Gigabit Ethernet Ports with Passthrough Price $56 This was necessary for me and may not be for you. The modem and router in my apartment are in my roommate’s room. So to get ethernet to the home lab, I was able to use these adapters which transmit the ethernet signal over the cooper power cables in the house. This is a cleaner solution than running a long cable through the house.\nTP-Link 8 Port Switch - new, half-off\nPrice: $27 Not entirely necessary at this stage but will makes it easy to add additional machines in the future.\nThat brings the price of hardware to $333 + taxes/shipping. Nice!\nIn the process, I will make a few changes to my home office including reorganzing the office closet. Here are a few additional purchases I made to help organize my things a little better:\nA new steel-wire shelving unit - Home Depot 15ft cat6 cable - Home Depot Cable tie mounts - Amazon Luckily I had an old monitor lying around I used for the initially server setup. Finally with a pair of scissors, a few zip ties and a power strip, I have all that I need to get started.\nHardware Setup The setup is straight forward.\nPlug in one Powerline Adapter to outlet near the router and then connect it to the router with an ethernet cable.\nPlug in the other Powerline Adapter near the home lab and connect it to the switch (yellow cable). Connect the switch to the home lab (black cable).\nConnect the monitor, keyboard and mouse, then turn on the server.\nThat’s it for the hardware setup.\nConclusion I’m excited to get started with this project. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while and I’m glad I’m finally getting around to it. In another post, I’ll go over the the initial configuration of the server and Kubernetes setup.\nLooks over both shoulders…. I just setup a desktop computer in my office closet and called it a home server.\n","wordCount":"697","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-08-27T22:15:22-07:00","dateModified":"2024-08-27T22:15:22-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.eskild.blog/posts/2024-08-27-hl0/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"eskild.blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.eskild.blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/ accesskey=h title="eskild.blog (Alt + H)">eskild.blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/projects title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/tags title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/index.xml title=RSS><span>RSS</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>In the beginning, there was hardware</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-08-27 22:15:22 -0700 -0700'>August 27, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div><div><br></div><div class=post-tags><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/tags/homelab/>Homelab</a></li><li><a href=https://www.eskild.blog/tags/hardware/>Hardware</a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>The home lab.
