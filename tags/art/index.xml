<h2 id="updated-tech-stack">Updated Tech Stack</h2>
<p>During this recent holiday break, I had some time to work on  
<a href="https://eskild.art" target="_blank">eskild.art</a>, and I&rsquo;m excited to share those updates here. Although I haven&rsquo;t added any new art (yet), the site has been redesigned from the ground up.</p>
<p>The initial version was a FastAPI app on GCP Cloud Run using basic HTML Jinja templates; it was simple but got the job done. The new version is now running  
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> with  
<a href="https://django-tailwind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> using Postgres deployed on Google&rsquo;s Kubernetes Engine (GKE).</p>
<p> 
<a href="https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/856639005462417409" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s certainly amusing</a> to see a basic web app deployed on a compute environment which is orders of magnitude more expensive than the previous environment. However, I wanted to take this opportunity to brush up on Kubernetes and GCP while leaving room to growth. Who knows, maybe one day I&rsquo;ll deploying it on the Kubernetes cluster running on my  
<a href="https://eskild.blog/posts/2024-08-27-hl0/" target="_blank">homelab</a> ;)</p>
<p>I chose Django because it has many great features &ldquo;out-of-the-box,&rdquo; such as the admin panel and because I resonate with their slogan: &ldquo;The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="coding-with-ai">Coding with AI</h2>
<p>Going from an empty repo to a simple site deployed on GKE in less than three weeks is moderately impressive. That said, considering this was something I hacked on a few hours here and there, I quite pleased.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest with myself, this is something I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve accomplished in this timeframe without the assistance of AI tools like  
<a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> and  
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> (o1). In fact, if I had to guess, I would say that about 90% of the code was AI-generated.</p>
<p>While I think tools like these are revolutionizing the software engineering field, I suspect it would&rsquo;ve taken someone without development experience quite a bit longer, mainly because the infrastructure setup and app deployment can be confusing and a bit intimidating. Getting a local Django app up and running was the easy part.</p>
<p>Cursor is one of the most impressive AI tools out there, but it&rsquo;s certainly not perfect. If you&rsquo;re not paying attention, it will add unnecessary files and duplicate existing functionality; hallucinations (or rather confabulations) are problems I don&rsquo;t see getting fully resolved anytime soon.</p>
<p>In general, these tools works best if you have a basic idea of what you&rsquo;re doing. And as the codebase become more complex, these AI tools tend to require more guidance and specialized prompting.</p>
<p>Besides speed-to-market and other business metrics, this experience has me wondering whether security and reliability will be some of the key differentiators going forward. We will likely see a lot more apps deployed by non-developers in the coming years but I suspect once their app start gaining traction, professional developers will come in and ensure the site can scale, is reliable and adheres to security best practices.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! I hope you enjoy the challenges and the art!</p>

<p>This quote by  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut</a> has been on my mind since I encountered it about a month ago. Good quotes can capture a truth about the world in an elegant and poetic ways, always making you wish you had come up with it yourself. The difficulty in trying to describe certain truths is that they cannot, by their very nature, be expressed in language.</p>
<p>So what truth does this quote gesture at? Why must we continually jump? And how does one develop wings?</p>
<p>In my own way of gesturing at these underlying ideas, I will reflect on a few other quotes.</p>

<a href="https://davidwhyte.com/" target="_blank">David Whyte</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strangely, every person always lives out their destiny no matter what they do, according to the way they shape the conversation&hellip; [our destiny&rsquo;s] promise may depend upon a brave participation, a willingness to hazard ourselves in a difficult world, a certain form of wild generosity with our gifts;&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our experience of life &ldquo;may depend upon a brave participation&rdquo; — the courage to admit ignorance while striving to eliminate it, the courage to say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; even if you&rsquo;re unsure you&rsquo;ll hear it repeated back to you, and the courage to look like a fool while you&rsquo;re improving your trade.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly expanding the legible, and when you do that, there&rsquo;s this penumbra of illegibility that surrounds it. That moves, but it gives you access to those other spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To think &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done, that&rsquo;s it&rdquo; is a terrible mistake; we must always be vigilant and ready to learn. As the &ldquo;other spaces&rdquo; around you expand, you must face them with renewed bravery and a deeper appreciation of what came before.</p>
<p>From  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky" target="_blank">Wayne Gretzky</a>, NHL hockey player (and me after my missed jump shot):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You miss 100% of the shots you don&rsquo;t take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You develop into a shooter by taking shots. There is no other way. This understanding unlocks a certain freedom; to grow, one needs to be challenged, and ultimately, it&rsquo;s not personal.</p>

<p>And why must we <em>continually</em> jump off cliffs? Isn&rsquo;t once enough?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not know the answer, and it doubtful that there is such a thing as &ldquo;an answer&rdquo; to problems of this kind [AI safety]. It is not just that finding the answer will be a process. The answer <em>will be</em> the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essential processes that don&rsquo;t evolve to survive in the new environment die. Adaptability is, has, and will likely always be an important ingredient for success. To be good at adaptation, you need to continually adapt.</p>
<p>And from  
<a href="https://www.mayaangelou.com/" target="_blank">Maya Angelo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can&rsquo;t practice any other virtue consistently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing something once doesn&rsquo;t require the same courage as doing it consistently does. We must continually admit ignorance, say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; and feel like fools because doing so continually is the only way to improve and find new cliffs to jump off of.</p>
