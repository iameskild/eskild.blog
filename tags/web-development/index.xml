<h2 id="updated-tech-stack">Updated Tech Stack</h2>
<p>During this recent holiday break, I had some time to work on  
<a href="https://eskild.art" target="_blank">eskild.art</a>, and I&rsquo;m excited to share those updates here. Although I haven&rsquo;t added any new art (yet), the site has been redesigned from the ground up.</p>
<p>The initial version was a FastAPI app on GCP Cloud Run using basic HTML Jinja templates; it was simple but got the job done. The new version is now running  
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> with  
<a href="https://django-tailwind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> using Postgres deployed on Google&rsquo;s Kubernetes Engine (GKE).</p>
<p> 
<a href="https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/856639005462417409" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s certainly amusing</a> to see a basic web app deployed on a compute environment that is literally four orders of magnitude more expensive than the previous environment. That said, I wanted to take this opportunity to brush up on Kubernetes and GCP while leaving room to grow. I chose Django because it has many great features &ldquo;out-of-the-box,&rdquo; such as the admin panel and the ability to add new apps quickly; I resonate with their slogan: &ldquo;The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="coding-with-ai">Coding with AI</h2>
<p>Going from an empty repo to a live site deployed on GKE in less than three weeks is impressive! It&rsquo;s especially impressive considering this was something I hacked on a few hours here and there as I spent most of my holiday break visiting family and friends. If I&rsquo;m being honest with myself, this is something I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve accomplished in this timeframe without the assistance of AI tools like  
<a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> and  
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> (o1). In fact, if I had to guess, I would say that 90-95% of the code was AI-generated.</p>
<p>While I think tools like these are revolutionizing the software engineering field, I suspect it would&rsquo;ve taken someone without development experience quite a bit longer, mainly because the infrastructure setup and app deployment can be confusing and a bit intimidating. Getting a local Django app up and running was quite easy.</p>
<p>Cursor is one of the most impressive AI tools out there, but it&rsquo;s certainly not perfect. If you&rsquo;re not paying attention, it will add unnecessary files and duplicate existing functionality. It works best if you have a basic idea of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>In general, as apps become more complex, these AI tools tend to require more guidance and specialized prompting.</p>
<p>Besides speed-to-market and other business metrics, this experience has me wondering whether security and reliability will be some of the key differentiators going forward.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! I hope you enjoy the challenges and the art!</p>
